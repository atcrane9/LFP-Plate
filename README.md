# LFP-Plate

The LFP Plate is a tool used in the implantation of multi-site Local Field Potential (LFP) electrodes. The design can be customized to each surgery, depending on the desired coordinates and depths of the electrodes. Bundles of electrodes are routed through each hole and fixed in place, then using the length of the "guide rods", are cut to the appropriate height using sharp scissors. 

Guide rods are placed next to the 0.75mm diameter holes (height = depth from bregma + 3 mm). 

There is a 0.6mm handle on the side that is useful during implant preparation and can be easily cut off with clippers once the implant has been prepared.


## Hardware

All files were printed using a Form3+ Printer, using GreyV4 resin\

Print Settings:

Form3+ Printer
PreForm Slicer 3.50.2.555
GreyV4 resin
Adaptive Layer Thickness
Default Print Settings (PreForm v2.0, 244rgg-17z7za)
Firmware 2.5.3


<!--### edit
Painter's tape was put on print bed to increase print adhesion with bed
* Make sure tape is completely flat
* No gaps between tape pieces
* If tape tears when removing print, replace with new piece
  
Nozzles used were either 0.4mm or 0.6mm, depending on specific part (Instructions for changing the nozzles [here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/changing-or-replacing-the-nozzle-mk2-5-s-mk3-s-mk3-5-s_2069))
* **<ins>Must</ins>** be printed using **<ins>0.4mm nozzle</ins>**

  * [Adapter](STL_Files/ISIA_Adapter.stl)
  * [Inner Gate](STL_Files/ISIA_Inner_Gate.stl)
  * [Outer Gate](STL_Files/ISIA_Outer_Gate.stl)

_Note: These 4 parts contain threads that allow them to screw together. However, the threads must be "broken in" after printing, which is done by repeatedly screwing/unscrewing the parts with each other until they can easily twist the full range with minimal friction._

* Can be printed using **<ins>0.6mm nozzle</ins>**
  * [Tube](STL_Files/ISIA_Tube.stl)
  * [Restrictor](STL_Files/ISIA_Restrictor.stl)

_Note: While all other parts are reusable between experiments after cleaning, the Restictors are not resuasble, as the restricted mice often slightly chew on them in an attempt to reach the other cage. We advise printing new Restrictors for each experiment, and disposing of them when the experiment ends._
